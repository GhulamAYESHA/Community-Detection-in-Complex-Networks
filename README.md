## Introduction
Networks, both natural and human-made, play crucial roles across disciplines such as biology, computer science, sociology, and physics. Community detection is a significant aspect of network theory, focusing on identifying clusters within networks where internal connections are denser than external ones. As data from social media, biology, and technology continues to grow, the need for advanced community detection techniques becomes critical. This study aims to explore community structures within credit card transaction networks to improve financial services, particularly in fraud detection and customer segmentation.

## Problem Statement
Despite advancements, community detection in complex networks remains a challenging research area due to network size, complexity, and evolving structures. Traditional methods often struggle with scalability, noise sensitivity, and parameter dependency. Additionally, the lack of a universal community definition leads to varied results under identical conditions.

## Aims and Objectives
The primary goal of this research is to analyze community structures in a network of credit card transactions using network analysis techniques and machine learning models. Key objectives include:

- Constructing a transactional network graph with customers and merchants as nodes and transactions as weighted edges.
- Validating community detection algorithms and machine learning models using a validation dataset.
- Comparing algorithm efficiency and identifying strengths and weaknesses in community detection.

## Methodology
This study employs both traditional graph-based algorithms (e.g., Girvan-Newman, Louvain, Infomap, Label Propagation) and machine learning models (e.g., Graph Convolutional Networks, Long Short-Term Memory) to analyze community structures. A dataset of 2000 credit card transactions serves as the foundation for building a transactional network graph. The study includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, graph construction, and algorithm implementation. The integration of machine learning models aims to enhance predictive and analytical insights.

## Results and Analysis
The study revealed distinct communities within the transaction network, demonstrating the varying effectiveness of different algorithms. Graph-based algorithms like Girvan-Newman excelled in identifying small, tightly-knit communities, while Louvain was effective for larger structures. Machine learning models, particularly GCN and LSTM, provided high classification accuracy and temporal analysis capabilities, highlighting dynamic changes in community structures.

## Conclusion
This research contributes to financial network analysis by offering robust tools for community detection in complex systems. The insights gained can enhance fraud detection, customer segmentation, and broader applications in epidemiology, marketing, and social networking. Future work could explore hybrid models and integrate additional data sources to improve accuracy and scalability in community detection techniques.
